There are many chat application that can connect user to other user. But, there's many data that consumed from user and sometimes it violates user privacy. So, I worked on this application to create a chat application that simple, secure and fast.

- Chat with other users
- Update user profile
- User authentications

Other features will be added in the future. When the main feature in the application can be used by user.
